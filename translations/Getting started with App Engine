#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

#Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
    - Initialize App Engine.

    - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

    - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

    - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

#Set up your lab environment
    Activate Google Cloud Shell
    In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.
    click continue.

    gcloud is the command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

    You can list the active account name with this command:
        gcloud auth list
    Output:
        Credentialed accounts:
        - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
    Example output:
        Credentialed accounts:
        - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net

    You can list the project ID with this command:
        gcloud config list project
    Output:
        [core]
        project = <project_ID>
    Example output:
        [core]
        project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6

#Task 1: Activate App Engine
    Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
    When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.

    Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
    
    Navigate to the source directory:
        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
    Ensure that you are at the Cloud Shell command prompt.

    Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
        sudo apt-get update

    Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
        sudo apt-get install virtualenv
        If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
        virtualenv -p python3 venv

    Activate the virtual environment.
        source venv/bin/activate

    Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
        pip install  -r requirements.txt

    Run the application:
        python main.py
        Please ignore the warning if any.
    
    In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
    Result includes- Hello World!

    To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

#Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
    To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:
    Navigate to the source directory:
        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    Deploy your Hello World application.
        gcloud app deploy
        If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
    
    This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.

    Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
        gcloud app browse
    Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.

#Task 4: Disable the application
    gcloud app versions stop v1

Congratulations!
